Overall Goal: Using Household Pulse data, consider how outcomes of interest vary with vaccination status. Groups should prepare a 2-min presentation by one of the group members about their experiment process and results. You get 45 min to prepare.

This time, we reverse the order of steps from previous: first look at some of the data, then step back and think about it. (Not necessarily stating which order is best, just having you do meta-experiments on what is best way to do experiments.)

You might split the sample into groups: those who got a vaccine shot (RECVDVACC == "yes got vaxx"), those who did not (RECVDVACC == "no did not get vaxx"), but then you have to figure out how to deal with those who did not answer (or did not provide an answer that matches to yes or no) -- i.e. where (RECVDVACC == "NA") is true. What are some of the ways that those groups differ?

(Many students have issues picking a subset of the data, whether the females or the prime-aged (with Age >= 25 and Age <= 55) or working in certain industries or with certain degree categories. Here is some psuedo-code:
``` {r eval = FALSE}
# from orig_data, pick a subset
restrict1 <- (orig_data$x1 == 5) | (orig_data$x2 == "Blue")
data_new <- subset(orig_data,restrict1)

```
This outputs a new data frame with all the same variables as the original data frame, but only for those folks with X1 value of 5 **or** those with X2 value of Blue. (Note that the vertical line symbolizes logical **or**; an ampersand would symbolize logical **and**. Those give different subgroups.) Obviously you'd want to set your own restrictions, this is just giving you the basic framework of how to create a subset to focus on certain observations.)

Now consider the experiment protocol after peeking at some of the data. Do you want to limit the comparisons further? For example, you might want to consider whether people who are not themselves vaxxed are less likely to get their kids vaxxed -- but you shouldn't then compare people without kids. Think about what is a reasonable comparison set.

Comparing those two reasonable groups, what is the size of the difference in outcome? What is the standard error of that difference measure? Using your stats knowledge, how confident are you, that the difference is actually there and not an artefact of sampling?

Look at the crosstabs and compute the marginal probabilities. How do those inform? To check if you did it right, compute some of the marginal probabilities using Bayes' Theorem. Is your crosstab mutually exclusive and exhaustive?

What other factors could explain the difference in outcome? Among your list of differences in vaxx status, are there some potential confounders such as age or education? What else? 

What additional evidence would you look at? What conclusions could you draw from that? How confident would you be, in the conclusions made? What other conclusions could be drawn, from that same evidence? If you were to try to persuade someone, imagine what evidence would be required to persuade a person with the opposite view?
